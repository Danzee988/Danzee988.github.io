        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to combine blockchain technology with AI-based malware detection systems to provide enhanced data security, 
            focusing on sharing malware signatures. The growing improvement in cyber threats, including novel malware, requires robust detection 
            mechanisms that will be capable of adaptation in real time. AI and machine learning models as we know them do offer advanced capabilities 
            for detecting malware, however they face challenges when it comes to securely managing and sharing threat intelligence, especially when 
            companies want to collaborate together. This project proposes the use of blockchain technology to securely store and transfer malware 
            signatures in a decentralized, tamper-resistant manner. With the use of blockchains decentralized architecture and transparency, organizations
            will be able to share any newly discovered malware without compromising the integrity of the data. The system aims to improve collaboration, 
            reduce risks of unauthorized data tampering, and enhance overall malware detection efficiency. Key challenges such as computational overhead, 
            latency, and scalability will also be explored, with the ultimate goal of providing a secure, scalable platform for threat intelligence sharing.
